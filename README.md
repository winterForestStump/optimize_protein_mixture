# optimize protein mixture
This Streamlit application optimizes protein mixtures using linear programming to minimize cost while meeting protein concentration requirements.

The application is in Russian because it deals with agricultural trading practices in Russia.

### Important Warning!
The contribution of carbamide to "visible protein" is calculated as 2.875% per 1% of carbamide. The addition of carbamide (urea) to falsify food products is illegal and extremely dangerous to consumers' health! Urea is not a protein and has no nutritional value. Its consumption can lead to severe poisoning and kidney damage. This calculation is provided for theoretical and educational purposes only, to understand how analytical methods work and how they can be exploited in making profits.

### takeaway
Using the application demonstrates the optimal financial outcome (maximum profit) and mixing ratios when attempting to produce a mixture with a specified protein content. It is also worth noting that using urea as an additive significantly increases the "visible" protein content in the mixture, and the financial result improves considerably, which incentivizes market participants to use this method. The presence of urea can be detected through chemical analysis in a professional laboratory by measuring the difference between crude protein content (via Kjeldahl method) and true protein content (via Bernstein method). Plant-based raw materials do not contain non-protein nitrogen, so if a difference of more than 5% is observed, it can be suspected that the product has been adulterated with ammonium salts.
